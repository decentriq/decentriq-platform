class TabularDataNodeBuilder:
    """
    Helper class to construct the triplet of nodes consisting of a data node to
    store tabular input data, as well as a schema validation computation.

    In a data clean room computations and the data they depend on are expressed in terms
    of graphs where computations are represented by *compute nodes* and input datasets are
    represented by *data nodes*.
    With tabular input data, it is possible to validate the input data and check whether it
    corresponds to a pre-defined schema. This validation is a computation in itself so in
    order to validate the input data, we need to add an additional compute node on top of the

    This class will add the necessary nodes to your data clean room.

    After having constructed an object of this class, call its `add_to_builder` method
    and pass it a `DataRoomBuilder` instance. This will add the necessary nodes and required
    user permissions to the builder instance.

    Data should be published to the node with id `input_node_id` and be read from `output_node_id`.

    This class uses a special convention for the ids of the nodes added to the data room based on
    the table name given to the builder. Assuming you use `"my_table"` as the `table_name` when
    instantiating the `TabularDataNodeBuilder`, then the following three nodes will be added:

    1. `my_table_leaf` - the data node to which you can upload data.
    2. `my_table_verification` - the id of the compute node that verifies the schema of the data.
        Subsequent SQL compute nodes should read data from this node.

    The helper function `upload_and_publish_tabular_dataset` will upload, publish, and validate your
    data automatically, without you having to worry about internal naming.
